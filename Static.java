       /*   There is major difference between Static and Non-Static Members

        Static:

        A static method is a method that belongs to a class, but it does not belong to an instance
        of that class and this method can be called without the instance or object of that class.
        Every method in java defaults to a non-static method without static keyword preceding it.

        (a):Belongs to class
        (b):Can be accessed using ClassName.memberName
        (c):Variables initialized with default values at the time of class loading.
        (d):All object of class share a single copy of static variables.

        Non-Static:

         A Non-static method is a method that belongs to a object.

        (a):Belongs to object
        (b):Can be accessed using object.memberName;
        (c):Non-static variable initializes with default value at the time of object creation.
        (d):Each object has one local copy of non-static variables.*/
